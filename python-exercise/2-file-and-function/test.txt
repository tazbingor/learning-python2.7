        WILLIAM WALLACE:"Fight,and you may die.Run,and you"ll live at least a while.
    And dying in your beds many years from now.
    Would you be willing to trade?
    All the days from this day to that,
    for one chance,just one chance,
    to come back here and tell our enemies
    that they may take our lives,
    but they
    "ll never take our Freedom!"
    Freedom——
